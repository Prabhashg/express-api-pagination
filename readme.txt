Aim: to build own api and fetch data from that api only after serving it on localhost, 
	and then rendering that data in frontend html table as before using public API.

Learnings: express js
	   routing
	   get method
	   mvc - model views controller pattern
	   app(express()) vs router(express.Router())
	   
problems: CORS error - cross-origin resource sharing blocked by browser
	   Solution: used "cors" middleware to unblock CORS policy
